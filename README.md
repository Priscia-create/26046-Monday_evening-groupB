# Java Exceptions Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates various Java exception types through individual example files. Each file contains a specific scenario where an exception is raised and showcases how to handle or avoid it effectively. Understanding these examples is critical for writing robust and error-tolerant Java programs.

## Contents

1. **IOExceptionExample.java**
   - Demonstrates handling of input/output exceptions, such as issues with reading from or writing to files.

2. **FileNotFoundExceptionExample.java**
   - Explores scenarios where a specified file cannot be located and the appropriate exception handling mechanisms.

3. **EOFExceptionExample.java**
   - Illustrates how to handle end-of-file exceptions encountered during file reading operations.

4. **SQLExceptionExample.java**
   - Focuses on SQL-related exceptions, showcasing how to manage errors when interacting with databases.

5. **ClassNotFoundExceptionExample.java**
   - Shows how to handle cases where a required class is not found at runtime.

6. **ArithmeticExceptionExample.java**
   - Explains handling arithmetic errors, such as division by zero.

7. **NullPointerExceptionExample.java**
   - Covers the prevention and handling of null pointer dereferencing.

8. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionExample.java**
   - Demonstrates handling of illegal array indexing.

9. **ClassCastExceptionExample.java**
   - Explains handling situations where an object is cast to an incompatible type.

10. **IllegalArgumentExceptionExample.java**
    - Showcases how to manage invalid arguments passed to methods.

11. **NumberFormatExceptionExample.java**
    - Highlights handling of invalid number format conversions.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Follow any prompts or observe the exception handling behavior in the output.

## Purpose
This project serves as an educational resource for understanding Java's exception hierarchy and best practices for handling errors effectively. By studying these examples, developers can:
- Identify common exception scenarios.
- Learn to implement proper error handling mechanisms.
- Write cleaner and more robust Java code.
